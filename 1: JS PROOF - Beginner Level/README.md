# Indian Food NFT Collection

Welcome to the flavorful world of Indian Food NFTs! This JavaScript code presents a delightful project that allows you to create and display Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing various mouthwatering Indian dishes. üçõüå∂Ô∏è

## Code Explanation

The code begins by initializing an empty array called `indianFoodNFTs`, which will serve as the repository for all our delectable food NFTs.

### Functions

1. **createFoodNFT**: This function creates an NFT object and stores it in the `indianFoodNFTs` array. It takes four parameters: `name`, `cuisine`, `spicyLevel`, and `vegNonveg`. Each parameter contributes to defining the characteristics of the Indian food NFT.

2. **displayFoodNFTs**: In this function, we loop through the `indianFoodNFTs` array and print the details of each Indian Food NFT to the console. The details include the `name`, `cuisine`, `spicyLevel`, and `vegNonveg` properties.

3. **getTotalFoodNFTs**: This function simply logs the total number of Indian Food NFTs that have been minted so far, which is equivalent to the length of the `indianFoodNFTs` array.

### Example NFTs

As an example, we've minted three Indian Food NFTs:
- "Biryani" - Hyderabadi cuisine, High spicy level, Non-vegetarian.
- "Butter Chicken" - Punjabi cuisine, Medium spicy level, Non-vegetarian.
- "Masala Dosa" - South Indian cuisine, Medium spicy level, Vegetarian.

Feel free to explore, create your unique NFTs, and savor the array of Indian flavors!
